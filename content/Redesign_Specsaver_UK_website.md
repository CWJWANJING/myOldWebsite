## Background
### What is Specsavers?

Specsavers (short for Specsavers Optical Group Ltd) is an international optical retail chain based in the UK, Ireland, Australasia and the Nordic countries. The chain provides eyesight testing services as well as selling glasses, sunglasses, and contact lenses.

### Motivation

One day I was browsing through the Specsavers UK website (because I'm in the UK) to buy some contact lenses. (For convenience, I will refer Specsavers UK website just as Specsavers, other website branches will be specified.) When I tried to register a new account, I couldn't find the register button. All I can find is a log in button, I was confused and switched to use Vision Express (another British optical company) instead. That's how I found the first potential pain point, the register feature.

After that I searched on the Internet to find out how exactly one can register an account on Specsavers. Then I found the following information on the Specsavers Australia website:

</img>

***"Your account can be created after your first purchase. Once you have completed your order, you will be prompted to enter a password. This will automatically set up your account with all the details from your order."***

After seeing that, I went to search 'create account' and 'account' in the UK website, but I didn't find similar information as shown above. Searching 'register' I found one related Q&A:

<img class="image">
  <img src="/images/Specsavers/doIneedToRegister.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Do I need to register</figcaption>
</img>

***"No, you don't need to register to purchase items from the Specsavers website.***

***However, setting up an account will make it easier and quicker to place your orders, enables you to use our Express re-order feature and lets you track your orders online."***

From my point of view, I thought it meant I don't need to have an account to buy products from the website, but if I have an account everything will be easier. To me, it still doesn't tell me how to register on the website.

I tried to see if it's true that I don't need to register when I try to purchase something. So I tried to add the sunglasses to my basket for the sake of convenience, because most of other things require entering prescriptions. Then I found the second potential pain point, which is that all there was no option for a non-prescription sunglasses. There are only options for 'Reading' and 'Distance'. All the sunglasses require to enter the prescriptions.

I researched on the Internet again to find out why Specsavers doesn't have non-prescription sunglasses. Then on the Specsavers Australia website again, I found the following information:

<img class="image">
  <img src="/images/Specsavers/normalSunglasses.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Can you buy normal sunglasses from Specsavers</figcaption>
</img>

***"We now sell non-prescription glasses online. Simply select 'non-prescription' to buy glasses or sunglasses without a prescription. You cannot claim non-prescription glasses using your optical extras."***

From the above information, I know that Specsavers Australia website sells non-prescription sunglasses, but probably not the case for the UK website. Still, I think it would be better for the website informs users that they do not sell non-prescription sunglasses than leaving users confused. I wonder if there's any other people who would have same experience as mine.

###Â Problem Validation
To validate my potential pain points, I carry out a user research.
