Summary:<img src="/images/mukulele/finalDesign.png" alt="" class="headerimg"/>Mukulele is a ukulele learning app that aims to motivate users to keep practising everyday.


##The problem
I wanted to help people who don’t have time to practice and learn the ukulele every day because I have a ukulele, and I **found it hard to keep learning and practising the ukulele**. According to the survey I did for people who are interested in ukulele or ukulele learners (around 20), this is the most common pain point they have.

##The solution
I designed a ukulele learning app that will motivate people to play the ukulele every day. It **minimizes the time that people need to spend on the ukulele while still making progress**and has a **virtual pet** to keep them entering the app every day.

##My role
I ran the entire project by myself by surveying to find out people’s needs and made the persona according to the needs and pain points I found. I also did the customer journey map, paper prototyping, low fidelity prototype and high fidelity prototype, and conducted the usability test.

##Empathise with users
To empathise with users and find out their needs I did **surveys from people who are interested in Ukulele or have experience with it**. Surveying is one of the quickest and easiest ways to gather information in a short amount of time. Plus remaining COVID safe. I sent out the surveys on social media and in the end, 21 people responded. After summarising the results, here’s the persona I created based on the top three needs and pain points:

##Ideate solutions
I did some research on existing Ukulele learning apps, such as Yousician. I adapted the **gamified song challenge concept** to make the practising experience more fun for the users. As illustrated in the final design section. I used the [SCAMPER](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-scamper#:~:text=SCAMPER%20is%20an%20acronym%20formed,helps%20you%20explore%20new%20possibilities.) method to ideate. I also used the persona to produce an [experience vision](https://jmspool.medium.com/the-3-steps-for-creating-an-experience-vision-35f9d6ce378b), which acts as a picture of what users' experience of using the design will be like.

##Sketching & Wireframing
I started the design process by **sketching on paper**. I jotted down my very initial thoughts of what the **main functions** of this app should look like and what elements it should have.

##Testing my design
I did two runs of **user evaluation** with 5 people each run using the low-fidelity prototype shown in Figure 1. I used the **think-aloud** method to ask them to perform a few tasks and asked them to fill out a **survey** afterwards. Their feedback after the first user evaluation is summarised in Figures 2 and 3. And my changed design is shown in Figures 4 and 5.

####Adjusted design:

- **Added names under icons**

####Adjusted design:

- **Added coins indicator** indicating how many coins users have (***A symbol stating how many coins I have***)
- **Added information of how many coins do each song give users** (***How many coins do each song give me***)
- **Added options to choose the pet** (***Options to choose the pet***)
- **Added information of each suggested-to-practice song** (***Information about the suggested songs, whether they are randomly picked or I learned them***)
- **Added a tuner** (***A tuner***)

##Final results
After two runs of user evaluation, the suggested improvements are summarised in Figure 6 and 7. I changed the design accordingly. You can find the **interaction design** [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/NtW8DKFZKehVt4BqWOJPAG/High-Fidelity-Prototype?node-id=334%3A488&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=334%3A488).

####Adjusted design:

- **Added feedback when clicking on a page** by making the page icon darker and having shadows (***Not sure which page I was on***)
- **Renamed the tabs page to be Tabs** (***Not sure what Tabular means***)
- **Removed check-in button** because users might just check-in and don’t do any practice. Now if users want to earn coins they will have to either practice a song or learn a new lesson. (***Not sure what the check-in is for exactly***)

####Adjusted design:

- **Added a profile page** which **shows users’ statistics** such as learning experience points (***A statistics page to see my progress***)
- **Added plus signs before coins** to indicate how many coins can users **gain** when they practice a song or learn a new content (***A better indication that the coins will increase when practicing a song***)

##Self-reflection
This is my first user design case study. I’ve familiarised myself with the design process. I haven’t applied any colours to the design yet, which could be an extension project.
