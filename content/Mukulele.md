Summary:<img src="/images/mukulele/finalDesign.png" alt="" class="headerimg"/>Mukulele is a ukulele learning app that aims to motivate users to keep practising everyday.


##The problem
I wanted to help people who don’t have time to practice and learn the ukulele every day because I have a ukulele, and I found it hard to keep learning and practising the ukulele. According to the survey I did for people who are interested in ukulele or ukulele learners (around 20), this is the most common pain point they have.

##The solution
I designed a ukulele learning app that will motivate people to play the ukulele every day. It minimizes the time that people need to spend on the ukulele while still making progress, and has a virtual pet to keep them entering the app every day.

##My role
I ran the entire project by myself by doing the survey to find out people’s needs and made the persona according to the needs and pain points I found. I also did the customer journey map, paper prototyping, low fidelity prototype and high fidelity prototype, and conducted the usability test.

##Empathise with users
To empathise with users and find out their needs I did surveys from people who are interested in Ukulele or have experience with it. I sent out the surveys on social media and in the end, 21 people responded. After summarising the results, here’s the persona I created based on the top three needs and pain points:

##Ideate solutions
I did some research on existing Ukulele learning apps, such as Yousician. I adapted the gamified song challenge concept. As illustrated in the final design section. I used the [SCAMPER](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-scamper#:~:text=SCAMPER%20is%20an%20acronym%20formed,helps%20you%20explore%20new%20possibilities.) method to ideate and used the persona to produce the user journey map.

##Sketching & Wireframing
I started the design process by sketching on paper. I jotted down my very initial thoughts of what the main functions of this app should look like and what elements it should have.

##Testing my design
I did two runs of user evaluation with 5 people each run using the low-fidelity prototype shown in Figure 1. I used the think-aloud method to ask them to perform a few tasks and asked them to fill out a survey afterwards. Their feedback after the first user evaluation is summarised in Figure 2 and 3. And my changed design is shown in Figure 4 and 5.

The main problems were solved by having names under each icon.

##Final results
After two runs of user evaluation, the suggested improvements are summarised in Figure 6 and 7. I changed the design accordingly.

##Self-reflection
This is my first user design case study. I’ve familiarised myself with the design process. I haven’t applied any colours to the design yet, which could be an extension project.
