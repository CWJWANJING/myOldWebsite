Hello, my name is Wanjing Chen. I'm a Chinese postgraduate student who studies Artificial Intelligence degree at Queen Mary University of London, and I'm about to graduate in September 2021. Apart from programming, I'm interested in music, food, cooking, art and travelling. I will be using this website to share my thoughts, experiences and stories. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/CWJWANJING), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wanjingchen_/?hl=en).
