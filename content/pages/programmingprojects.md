Mukulele is a gamified ukulele learning app that aims to motivate users to keep learning ukulele. The main feature, gamified song challenge, was achieved by embedding the developed Unity visualisation into the Android app. Two runs of user evaluation were conducted to increase the usability of the app. The demonstration of the app can be found [here](https://youtu.be/APM2M3K48fY) Technologies used: Android Studio, Unity, C#

Deeper Blue was an assistive chess robot enabling disabled players to compete in tournaments. It helps to pick up the chess pieces to the given location through web-app. In a group of 9, I helped design the body of the robot using LEGO, built the connection between the robot and computer and worked on the web-app. Technologies used: EV3, python, JavaScript, TCP socket.
