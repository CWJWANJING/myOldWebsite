	<h1 class="post-title">How I travel from the UK to China during pandemic</h1>
	<span class="post-date">Wed 16 February 2022</span>
	<h2>Trip Preparation</h2>
<p>Until 2021.12, China only allows limited airlines and a limited number of flights per week. Finnair Airline was one of the permitted airlines, so I booked my flight from them. Each week there's only one day that has flights. I booked the flight with the shortest duration, 29 h 35 min, including an overnight transfer for 17 h 50 min. So from London Heathrow (LHR) to Helsinki Vantaa (HEL) was about 2 h 50 min and from Helsinki Vantaa (HEL) to Shanghai Pudong International (PVG) was about 8 h 55 min.</p>

</img></p>
<h3>All the bookings</h3>
<p>It's pretty complicated and unpleasant to travel to China during this particular time. Firstly, the flights are very <strong>expensive</strong>. Mine cost <strong>£3,000</strong> ish. Then before 7 days of my flight, I needed to take a Coronavirus (COVID-19) test (The nose and tonsils test) and the result required to be negative. I took the NHS Coronavirus (COVID-19) home test because it's free. I was worried about getting a positive result back then because I went to a concert not long before the test date. It was a small one, but the venue was packed. Two days before the flight, I needed a PCR + IgM antibody test (The nose and tonsils + the blood test). I did it at a Chinese pharmacy.</p>

</img></p>
<p>There are detailed posts on a Chinese app called <em>Red Book</em> about how to travel from the UK to China. So I followed the posts and knew that I needed to get an additional test: the Nucleocapsid Protein(N Protein) IgM Antibody Test because I took two doses of the Pfizer vaccination. They used something like activated vaccines, which will make the IgM antibody shown as positive. These tests before the flight cost around <strong>£350</strong>.</p>

  <figcaption>N Protein IgM antibody test result certificate</figcaption>
</img></p>
<p>I also needed to book the PCR + IgM antibody test at the Helsinki airport during the overnight transfer, which cost <strong>£255</strong>. The overnight transfer ensures the test results can come out before the next flight from Finland to China. So the total cost before the flight was about <strong>£3605</strong>.</p>
<h3>Lots of tests</h3>
<p>Ever since I booked the flight, I've been stressed. Some people got tested positive while at Helsinki airport. I heard some people needed to quarantine in Finland, and some needed to go back to the UK and then quarantine. That means all the money they spent before the flight would be wasted.</p>
<p>I needed to book the NHS test in time so that it would come on time. It needs to be the exact 7 days before the flight date. For example, if the flight is on a Wednesday, the test must be done on the previous Wednesday. I did the test twice to make sure there would definitely be a result because I heard some might come out unclear.</p>

</img></p>
<p>I ensured the cotton bar got all the liquid it needed by leaving the cotton bar in for longer for both tests. It was not pleasant at all. The result came out fine. On the same day, I needed to start recording my own temperature for the next 7 days. Then it was the PCR + IgM antibody test two days before the flight. They did the nose test for me. It was more pleasant than I did by myself and much deeper. They took my blood samples and I didn't press the wound properly, so it went bruised after a few days.</p>
<p>I filled out a few extra forms and had all the negative test results. One day before the flight, I needed to enter a mini app on WeChat to fill out an application form for a green QR code. The information is manually checked, and without the QR code, you can't get the boarding pass. The information includes the vaccination details and proof, passport details, visa status, test results, last 7 days' temperatures, hand-written declaration of staying in the UK for the past 14 days, etc..</p>
<h2>The Actual Flights</h2>
<h3>Arriving at Helsinki Vantaa airport</h3>
<p>Getting onto the first plane was not that different from pre-COVID time. After arriving at Helsinki Vantaa airport, I headed to the transfer service desk. There was a long queue. I showed the staff my green QR code, my passport. Then they pointed me to the PCR + IgM antibody test area. They did the nose + the blood test. The nurse who did the nose went really deep inside. It feels like it reaches my throat from my nose... There was also quite a bit of waiting.</p>

</img></p>
<p>Due to COVID restrictions, the airport hotel was closed. So any overnight transfer passengers need to stay overnight at the airport. I made a mistake by taking the overnight bag with me to the testing point. It was inconvenient to hold with your arms. I should have picked up the bag after I did the test because the bags were right next to the transfer service desk.</p>

</img></p>
<h3>Stay overnight at the airport</h3>
<p>The overnight bag includes a pair of slippers, a travel kit with a toothbrush and toothpaste, some moisturisers, earplugs and an eye mask, as well as the quilt and pillow. A bottle of water. The quilt was a bit thin. It was quite cold at the airport. I didn't sleep well at the airport. I was on my period. My body felt heavy and sore. There were some ambient sounds next to the spot I planned to sleep in. It was loud, and the light was bright. With the help of earplugs and the eye mask, I managed to sleep for 5 hours.</p>

<h3>The flight from Helsinki to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The next day was pretty easy. I waited for the result to come out and then used the new and old information to apply for the new green QR code. The previous one expired after arriving at the Helsinki airport. The airport staff gave the entire passengers on the same flight as me 2 x €17 vouchers. They can only be used for specific restaurants.</p>
<p>The flight journey was mostly the same before COVID. Except, you know for big planes they have 3 columns of seats (As labeled 1,2,3 on the picture below). For the side columns (Column 1 &amp; 3), I think they manually make the middle seat empty. It was good for me. I don’t usually like the window seats. It’s not convenient for me to go to the toilet and it feels like less legroom than the corridor seat. In this case, it was good for me.</p>

<h2>After Arriving at Shanghai Pudong Airport</h2>
<h3>While in the airport</h3>
<p>The procedure was quite simple too. I did the COVID (nose and tonsils test) and passed the border control. After collecting my luggage, the staff asked my final destination closer to the exit. My final destination was Hangzhou, which is in Zhejiang province and close to Shanghai. Different provinces have different quarantine policies. (Shanghai is a municipality directly under the Central Government.)</p>

</img></p>
<p>All quarantine needs to be done in hotels with people monitoring. There are two ways of quarantine for my destination. One is staying at Shanghai hotel for 14 + 7 days. Or 3 + 11 + 7,i.e. 3 days in Shanghai, 11 days in Jiaxing (a city in Zhejiang province, which is between Shanghai and Hangzhou), then 7 days in Hangzhou. I chose the latter one, mainly because I don't need to quarantine for too long consecutively, I could step outside for a little bit when the staff transfer me to a new hotel. Plus the hotel fee would be cheaper.</p>
<p><img class="image">

</img></p>
<p>Also, after quarantine in Shanghai, I need to take a train to Hangzhou, and if there’s a positive case in the same train, I will have to be back to quarantine again. It happened to one of my friends. That is not what I want. After I made my choice, I filled in an online form and waited for the staff to take a group of people, including me, to the hotel by a private sanitised bus.</p>
<h3>The quarantine hotels</h3>
<p>The hotels are all randomly assigned to people and you need to pay by yourself. The one in Shanghai that was assigned to me wasn't that great. The hotel is quite old, and I needed to wipe the furniture inside myself. They were dusty. I wasn't sure why it was like that. They did allow essential goods delivery and food that does not need extra care to be stored at normal temperature. It was a twin-bed room. Once I stepped inside the room, I cannot step outside of the room until quarantine ended. There was a small desk outside the door for placing food and parcel deliveries, I could open the door to collect food which the staff delivers. I can open the windows too.</p>

</img></p>
<p>The fourth morning, I got transferred to a Jiaxing hotel by a private bus. This hotel is where I'm currently staying. I got lucky this time. Although it does not allow food delivery and only allows essential goods delivery, it has a wide range of optional food selections. There are snacks and optional hot food that you can order from the hotel .</p>
<p>Most importantly, the room was much better than the previous hotel room. The decoration was more modern and felt cosier. Plus, the price was much cheaper than the Shanghai one, almost half cheaper.</p>

<p>Later about 9 days in my quarantine, I started to struggle a bit. Good thing that I was working remotely so a big part of the day can be occupied. For the rest of the time I was writing this blog, watching shows, and practicing the Chinese flute Xiao. There were a lot of food in each meal. I didn't really exercise much in the room, so ended up gaining some weight at the end of quarantine. Here are a few photos of the food they provided:</p>

</img></p>
<p>On the 14th day of my quarantine, I got transferred from Jiaxing to Hangzhou and started the final 7 days of my quarantine. The hotel I stayed in was a relatively old hotel, but I was on a very high floor so the view was better than the previous hotels.</p>

<h2>A short summary</h2>
<p>This is my experience travelling from the UK to China during the pandemic. My quarantine days are considered to be short. Some provinces require people to quarantine for 28 days. It's hard for Chinese people to enter China, not to mention foreigners. As a person who works in the UK and whose families are in China, I really hope China can reduce the quarantine time or come up with a better way to control the COVID situation soon.</p>
